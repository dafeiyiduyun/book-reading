 *       The Thread class saves some information attributes that can help us to identify a thread,
 *       know its status, or control its priority. These attributes are:
 * 
 *       ID: This attribute stores a unique identifier for each Thread.
 *       Name: This attribute store the name of Thread.
 *       Priority: This attribute stores the priority of the Thread objects. Threads can have a
 *       priority between one and 10, where one is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest
 *       one. It's not recommended to change the priority of the threads, but it's a possibility
 *       that you can use if you want.
 *       Status: This attribute stores the status of Thread. In Java, Thread can be in
 *       one of these six states: new, runnable, blocked, waiting, time waiting,
 *       or terminated.

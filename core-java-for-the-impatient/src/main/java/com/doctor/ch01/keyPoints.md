The	key	points	of	this	chapter	are:

1.	In	Java,	all methods	are	declared in	 a 	class.	You	invoke	 a	 nonstatic	method	on	an
object	of	 the	class	to 	which	the	method	belongs.
2.	Static	methods	are	not	invoked	on	objects.	Program	 execution	starts	with 	the	static
main	method.
3.	Java	has	eight	primitive	 types:	five	integral	types,	two	floating-point 	types,	and
boolean.
4.	The	Java	operators	and	control	structures	are	very	 similar	to 	those	of	 C	 or
JavaScript.
5.	The	Math	class	provides	common	mathematical	functions.
6.	String	objects	are	sequences	of	 characters	or,	more	precisely,	Unicode	code
points	in	the	UTF-16	encoding.
7.	With	the	System.out	object,	you	can	display	output	in	a	terminal	window.	A
Scanner	tied	to	System.in	lets	you	read	terminal	input.
8.	Arrays	 and	collections	can	be	used	to	 collect	elements	of 	the	same	type.

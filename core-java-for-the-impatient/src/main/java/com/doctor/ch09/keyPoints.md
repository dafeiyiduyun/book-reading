The	key	points	of	this	chapter	are:

- 	Input	streams		are	a	source	of		bytes,	and		output	streams		are	a	destination	for	bytes.

- 		Use	readers	and	writers	for	processing		characters.	Be	sure	to		specify	a	character encoding.

- 	 The	Files		class	has	convenience	methods	for	reading	all		bytes	or		lines	of		a	file.

- 	 The	DataInput	and	DataOutput	interfaces	have	methods	for	writing	numbers  in	binary	format.

- 	 Use	a	RandomAccessFile	or		a	memory-mapped	file	for	random	access.

- 	 A		Path	is		an	absolute		or		relative	sequence	of		path	components	in	a	file	system.

Paths	can	be	combined	(or	“resolved”).

- 	 Use	the	methods	of		the	Files		class	to		copy,	move,	or		delete	files	and	to

recursively		walk	through	a	directory	tree.

- 		To		read	or		update	a		ZIP	file,	use	a	ZIP	file	system.

- 	 	You	can	read	the	contents	of		a	web	page	with		the	URL	class.	To		read	metadata	or

write	data,	use	the	URLConnection		class.

- 	 With	the	Pattern	and	Matcher	classes,	you	can	find	all		matches	of		a	regular

expression	in		a	string,	as	well		as	the	captured	groups	for	each	match.

- 	 	The	serialization	mechanism	can	save	and		restore	any	object	implementing	the

Serializable	interface,	provided	its	instance	variables	are	also		serializable.

The	key	points	of	 this 	chapter	are:


- Instance	variables	and	 static 	variables	are	collectively	 called 	fields.	The	fields, methods,	

and	nested	classes/interfaces	inside	a	class	are	collectively 	called	its  members.

-   A	 subclass 	can	inherit	 or	 override	methods	from	the	superclass.

- 	Use	the	super	keyword 	to 	invoke	 a	 superclass	method	or	  constructor.

-  	A	final	 method 	cannot	be	overridden;	a	final	 class	cannot	be	extended.

- 	An	abstract 	method	has	no	implementation;	an	abstract	class	cannot	be instantiated.

-  A	protected	member 	of	a	subclass 	is 	accessible	in	a	subclass	 method,	but	only

when	applied	to	  objects 	of		the	same	subclass.

- 	Every	class	is	a	subclass 	of 	Object	 which	 provides	methods	toString, equals,	hashCode,	and	clone.

- 	Each	enumerated	type	is	a	subclass		of		Enum	which	provides		methods	toString, valueOf,	and	compareTo.

-	The	Class	class	provides		information	about	a	Java		type,	which	can	be	a	class, array,	interface,	primitive 	type,	or void.

-  You	can	use	a	Class	object		to		load		resources	that		are	placed		alongside	class	files.

-  You	can	load 	classes	from	locations	other	than	the	class	path	by	using	a	class	loader.

- The	reflection	library	 enables	 programs		to		discover		members	of		arbitrary		objects, access	variables,	and	invoke	methods.

-  Proxy	objects	dynamically	implement		arbitrary		interfaces,	routing	all		method invocations		to		a	handler.

The	key	points	of	this	chapter	are:

1.	The	Collection	interface	provides		common	methods	for	all		collections,	except

for	maps	which	are	described	by	the	Map		interface.

2.	A	list	is	a	sequential	collection	in		which	each	element	has	an	integer	index.

3.	A	set	is	optimized	for	efficient	containment		testing.	Java		provides		HashSet		and

TreeSet	implementations.

4.	For	maps,	you	have	the	choice		between	HashMap	and		TreeMap		implementations.

A	LinkedHashMap	retains	insertion		order.

5.	The	Collection	interface	and	Collections	class	provide	many	useful

algorithms:	set	operations,	searching,	sorting,	shuffling,	and	more.

6.	Views	provide	access	to		data	stored		elsewhere		using	the	standard	collection  interfaces.

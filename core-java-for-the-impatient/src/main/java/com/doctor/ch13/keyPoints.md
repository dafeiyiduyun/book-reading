The	key	points	of	this	chapter	are:

- Translating	an	application		for	international		users	requires	more	than	translating

messages.	In		particular,	formatting		for	numbers	and	dates	varies		widely		across	the world.

- A	locale	describes	language	and	formatting		preferences	for	a		population		of		users.

- The	NumberFormat	and	DateTimeFormat	classes	handle	locale-aware

formatting		of		numbers,	currencies,	dates,	and	times.

- 	The	MessageFormat	class	can	format	message	strings	with		placeholders,	each	of

which	can	have	its	own		format.

- 	Use	the	Collator	class	for	locale-dependent	sorting	of		strings.

-	The	ResourceBundle	class	manages	localized		strings	and	objects	for	multiple locales.

- 	The	Preferences	class	can	be	used	for	storing	user	preferences	in	a	platform independent	way.

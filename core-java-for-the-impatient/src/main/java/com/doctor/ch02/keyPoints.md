The	key	points	of	this	chapter	are:

1.	Mutator	methods	change	the	state	of	 an	object;	accessor	methods	don’t.

2.	In	 Java,	variables	don’t	hold	 objects;	they	hold	 references	to	 objects.

3.	Instance	variables	and	method	implementations	are	declared 	inside	the	class  declaration.

4.	An	instance	method	is	invoked	on	an	object,	which	is	accessible	through	the	this reference.

5.	A	constructor	has	the	same	name	as	the	class.	A	class	can	have	multiple (overloaded)	constructors.

6.	Static	variables	don’t	belong	to 	any	objects.	Static	methods	are	not	invoked	on objects.

7.	Classes	are	organized	into	packages.	Use 	import	declarations	so	that	you	don’t	have

to 	use	the	package	name	in	your	programs.

8.	Classes	can	be	nested	in	other	classes.

9.	An	inner	class	is	a	nonstatic	nested	class.	Its	instances	have	a	reference	to	 the	 object

of	 the	enclosing	class	that	constructed	it.

10.	The	javadoc	utility	processes	source	files,	producing	HTML	files	with

declarations	and	programmer-supplied	comments.

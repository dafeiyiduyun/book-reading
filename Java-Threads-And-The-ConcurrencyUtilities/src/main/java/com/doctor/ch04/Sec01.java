 *       Each ThreadLocal instance describes a thread-local variable, which is a variable that
 *       provides a separate storage slot to each thread that accesses the variable. You can think of
 *       a thread-local variable as a multislot variable in which each thread can store a different
 *       value in the same variable. Each thread sees only its value and is unaware of other threads
 *       having their own values in this variable.
